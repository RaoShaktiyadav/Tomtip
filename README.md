## End Notes

In this project we tried to me the clone of the TomTop wesite as close to real one by using all the technical skills that we have learned up until now. We tried making it using HTML, CSS, Javascripts. Different functionalitie like adding data to the cart and checking out is working. Alongside that we also tried to make our site responsive. Workflow is similar to original.




## Limitations

All the pages are not fully cloned but we tried to make it as similar as posible. As we have less members we are not able to make the site site as exact as we wanted. But we were able able to cloned the workflow atleast.
